		<h6>
			As a group, we decided to go with a qualitative approach to gaining more understanding about </br>
			the product. We aimed to understand the product's usability through informants; observe how they interact </br>
			with the drone as well as receiving their opinions and thoughts on the product itself.</br>
			Our method of assessing the product was to have 6 people interviewed by our group. They were given </br>
			the product and have 10-15 minutes to figure out how to use the product, without any help from the team members.
			</br>
			They were to spend time with the product and while doing so, at least one of our team members will be present </br>
			to observe the interviewee's interaction with the drone, noting down any important information regarding the
			interaction </br>
			between user and product. </br> </br>

			The next part of this process is to interview the user(s). We had asked them questions regarding the product. </br>
			Questions that would give us more information and detail on aspects such as visuals, hardware ergonomics and design,
			software </br>
			and user interface usability and design, and other pros and cons that the interviewee's would like to add. </br>
			</br>

			Once data on their experiences are collected, each member is to compile a low-level report on their collected data.
			</br>
			Each report, created by the members, will be visible for the other members. We compiled all if their information
			into </br>
			this report, further explaining the usability of our chosen product; how well is it designed for the user and
			comparing the </br>
			found information to our initial thoughts on the product. </br> </br>

			Our report further explains many aspects of the product. </br></br>

			- Visuals: </br>
			How well is the box designed(Visual-wise)? </br>
			Drone visuals </br>
			Controller visuals </br>
			Other hardware visuals </br></br>

			- Hardware Ergonomics: </br>
			Controller design </br>
			Drone design </br>
			Other hardware </br></br>

			- Software Design: </br>
			Accessibility of the application</br>
			Initial Usability (Connection Process)</br>
			Graphical User Interface Design </br></br>

			All of these will be covered in this report. </br>
