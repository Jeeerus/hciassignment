			<p>As a group, we decided to go with a qualitative approach to gaining more understanding about <br>
			the product. We aimed to understand the product's usability through informants; observe how they interact <br>
			with the drone as well as receiving their opinions and thoughts on the product itself.<br>
			Our method of assessing the product was to have 6 people interviewed by our group. They were given <br>
			the product and have 10-15 minutes to figure out how to use the product, without any help from the team members. <br>
			They were to spend time with the product and while doing so, at least one of our team members will be present <br> 
			to observe the interviewee's interaction with the drone, noting down any important information regarding the interaction <br>
			between user and product. <br> <br></p>
			
			<p>The next part of this process is to interview the user(s). We had asked them questions regarding the product. <br>
			Questions that would give us more information and detail on aspects such as visuals, hardware ergonomics and design, software <br>
			and user interface usability and design, and other pros and cons that the interviewee's would like to add. <br> <br></p>
			
			<p>Once data on their experiences are collected, each member is to compile a low-level report on their collected data. <br>
			Each report, created by the members, will be visible for the other members. We compiled all if their information into <br>
			this report, further explaining the usability of our chosen product; how well is it designed for the user and comparing the <br>
			found information to our initial thoughts on the product. <br> <br></p>
			
			<p>Our report further explains many aspects of the product. <br><br></p>
			
			<p>- Visuals: <br>
				How well is the box designed(Visual-wise)? <br>
				Drone visuals <br>
				Controller visuals <br> 
				Other hardware visuals <br><br></p>
			
			<p>- Hardware Ergonomics: <br>
				Controller design <br>
				Drone design <br>
				Other hardware <br><br></p>
				
			<p>- Software Design: <br>
				Accessibility of the application<br>
				Initial Usability (Connection Process)<br>
				Graphical User Interface Design <br><br></p>
			
			<p>All of these will be covered in this report.<br> <br></p>
